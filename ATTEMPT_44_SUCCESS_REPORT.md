## 🔧 CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. **Blueprint Registration Conflict Resolution** ✅
**Problem:** Both `orchestration_api.py` and `mama_bear_orchestration_api.py` defined Flask Blueprints with the same name `orchestration_bp`, causing route conflicts.

**Solution:**
```python
# BEFORE (Conflict):
orchestration_bp = Blueprint('orchestration', __name__)

# AFTER (Fixed):
legacy_orchestration_bp = Blueprint('legacy_orchestration', __name__)
```

### 2. **App.py Integration Fix** ✅
**Problem:** Conflicting Blueprint registration preventing enhanced API from loading.

**Solution:**
```python
# BEFORE (Conflicting):
from api.orchestration_api import orchestration_bp
app.register_blueprint(orchestration_bp)

# AFTER (Proper Integration):
if API_INTEGRATION_AVAILABLE and integrate_orchestration_with_app:
    integrate_orchestration_with_app(app, socketio)
```

### 3. **Type Annotation & Import Fixes** ✅
- Fixed syntax errors in `complete_integration.py`
- Corrected type hints: `Dict[str, Any] = None` → `Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None`
- Resolved corrupted import statements
